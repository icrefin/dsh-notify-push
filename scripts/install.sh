# Why a tarball and not `dsh plugin add /this/directory`: a `link:` dependency
# points OUTSIDE the profile's node_modules, so it is only reachable once the
# harness host has registered that path as a linked root — which happens at
# boot. A packed tarball installs as a real directory under
# `<profile>/node_modules/`, the same shape a registry plugin has, so the
# installation's module-interception layer resolves its peers immediately.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install.sh                 pack, then print instructions
#   scripts/install.sh --profile tui   pack, then install into a CLI-managed profile

Install it from the app:  Settings → Plugins → install, and give it this path:

    $TARBALL

The desktop profile is owned by the Electron application, so \`dsh plugin add\`
refuses it; the Plugins page (or the plugin-manager tool) is the supported path.

After installing, RESTART the app. A bundle added to a running profile cannot be
imported by that process: its module path is not in the resolution the harness
computed at boot, so the entry reports "failed to import" until the next start.
