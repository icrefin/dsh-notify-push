# Boot dsh-notify-push inside an ISOLATED dsh profile, without touching the
# profile the desktop app is using.
#
# It creates a private dsh home under `.dev-home/` (gitignored), initializes a
# profile from the shipped `web` template, installs this package into it as a
# `link:` dependency, and boots the web UI on its own port.
#
# Why this exists: it is the only way to prove the host half mounts, the client
# bundle reaches the boot graph, and the slot registration lands — all without
# risking the live profile. It writes nothing outside this package.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-profile.sh boot [port]     create if needed, then boot
#   scripts/dev-profile.sh dump            print the composed profile tree
#   scripts/dev-profile.sh url [port]      print the served client bundle URL
#   scripts/dev-profile.sh remove          delete .dev-home entirely
#
# Environment:
#   DSH_APP   path to "DeepSeek Harness.app" (default: /Applications/...)
